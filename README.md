# Hello! I'm Amy. 

I currently work as an investigative data reporter at [Scripps News](https://scrippsnews.com). I help write and report stories using datasets and code on a variety of topics, including [public](https://www.scrippsnews.com/scripps-news-investigates/scripps-news-investigation-a-decade-a-contempt-order-and-100m-later-flint-is-not-fixed) [infrastructure](https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/infrastructure/buttigieg-responds-to-scripps-news-investigation-into-ailing-bridges),   [healthcare](https://www.scrippsnews.com/investigations/high-ratings-for-nursing-homes-may-not-give-full-story-about-care-problems-deaths), and [thoroughbred racing](https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/a-new-push-to-protect-racehorses-is-leaving-behind-young-thoroughbreds). You can check out more of my work [here](https://scrippsnews.com/team/amy-fan-1/). 

I was a part of the team that won a [2024 national Emmy](https://scripps.com/press-releases/scripps-news-wins-national-news-emmy-award-for-its-investigation-poisoned-water/) for our investigation into the [Flint water crisis 9 years in](https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/infrastructure/records-missing-phones-out-flint-water-crisis-not-over). A data analysis I prepared was a key part of the interview pressing the mayor of Flint on the lack of progress on the pipe replacement project. 

Previously, I worked at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) and the [Golub Center for Finance and Policy](https://gcfp.mit.edu/) and was a [Civic Digital Fellow](https://www.codingitforward.com/summer-fellowships) at the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm). I hold a B.S. in mathematics from Duke University, where I received a [full merit scholarship](https://ousf.duke.edu/merit-scholarships/ab-duke-scholars-program/). I'm a native Houstonian and a big fan of the [Institute of Engagement](https://iehouston.org) and [Shift Press](https://shift.press/).
