# Hello! I'm Amy. I'm a data reporter on the national investigative team at the Scripps Washington Bureau/Newsy

Previously, I thought I would become an economist or sociologist (I couldn't decide). Before journalism, I worked at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) and the [Golub Center for Finance and Policy](https://gcfp.mit.edu/) and was a [Civic Digital Fellow](https://www.codingitforward.com/summer-fellowships) at the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm). I've also conducted research on women's business ownership and educaitonal segregation. 

I have a B.S. in mathematics from Duke University, where I received a [full merit scholarship](https://ousf.duke.edu/merit-scholarships/ab-duke-scholars-program/). 

Outside of data, I'm also deeply interested in youth civic engagement. I was born and raised in Houston, and since high school, I've helped start and remained involved with the [Institute of Engagement](https://iehouston.org), [Shift Press](https://shift.press/), and the [HISD Student Congress](https://twitter.com/HISDStuCon).

If you have questions, ideas, or common interests, please reach out at (my github username) at gmail.com. I will likely love to talk more!
