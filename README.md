# Hello! I'm Amy. 

I'm interested in data, narratives, and inequality, particularly as they relate to technology, young people and cities.

Currently, I work as a full-time research assistant at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), where I've looked at the ethics of debt and municipal pension funds. I also became familiar with working with large datasets through analyzing individual credit score data across decades. 

I graduated with a B.S. in mathematics in 2020 from Duke University, where I received a [full merit scholarship](https://ousf.duke.edu/merit-scholarships/ab-duke-scholars-program/). While there, I wrote data-driven pieces for the Duke Chronicle, including pieces that showed that [the student body came from disproportionately wealthy public schools](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/04/fan-rich-kids) and that [the computer science major lacked racial and gender diversity](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/06/major-madness-racial-and-gender-equity-in-computer-science). I also did quantitative research on the opioid crisis at the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm) as a [Civic Digital Fellow](https://www.codingitforward.com/summer-fellowships), school segregation at a [National Science Foundation REU](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/sociology/reu/), and women's business ownership at the [Cook Center on Social Equity](https://socialequity.duke.edu/).

Outside of data, I'm also deeply interested in youth civic engagement. I was born and raised in Houston, and since high school, I've helped start and remained involved with the [Institute of Engagement](https://iehouston.org), [Shift Press](https://shift.press/), and the [HISD Student Congress](https://twitter.com/HISDStuCon).

I'm always on the lookout for interesting projects that combine my interests. If you have questions, ideas, or common interests, please reach out at (my github username) at gmail.com. I will likely love to talk more!
